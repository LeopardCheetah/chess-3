just a simple todo list 
things to tackle about this chess program:
(small)
- make the bot be able to play on the white side with this new algorithm
- >> also bring back the new ui and stuff
- implement pawn promotion into this algorithm 
- implement some temperature controls/randomness (gonna needa redo the system tho)
- update the centipawn values and the board eval state number things

(big)
- work on a game tree to help with better move calculations
- sync with lichess + actually move this bot over to lichess! 


things don't seem to be *that* bad so it's not like i'm gonna needa overhaul my code...right?
